# Clean code

- **Frontend**: Prefer `console.warn`/`console.error`; avoid `console.log` in production code. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` from `frontend/` before committing.
- **Backend**: Use logging in app code instead of `print()` for production paths. Run `black .` and `ruff check .` from `backend/` when making Python changes.
- See **docs/CLEAN_CODE.md** for full guidelines and commands.
